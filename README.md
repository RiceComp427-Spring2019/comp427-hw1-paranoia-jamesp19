## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - It's assumed that the team uses this stadium exclusively to practice when they're not playing games in other areas. 
  Furthermore, non-football organizations may occasionally use the stadium as well to practice (e.g. marching band).
- Assets:
  - One of the most important assets to protect is the stadium itself, both when games are being played in it and when it is 
  not in use. Considering the talent of the football team, the 
  stadium will no doubt be packed during games; if an attacker were to compromise the stadium's ability to ensure that 
  both teams play fairly, such as by interfering with the lights or altering the field turf, it could lead to an unfair 
  advantage for either team. In an even more dire scenario, an attacker could take advantage of the public football game schedule
  to know which days the stadium would be filled with people, then plan some kind of terroristic attack to hurt or kill thousands.
  - Another important asset to protect are the football teams themselves, when they are on the field. If an attacker, or perhaps even simply an 
  overzealous fan, were able to make
  their way onto the field during a game and interfere with the players, the best case scenario would be extreme embarrassment for
  the school for their inability to prevent such a thing from happening, and the worst case scenario would be the injuries or deaths of 
  players. Such an attack could even happen when the team is practicing alone in the stadium, not just during games. Thus, protection should be present at all times.
- Threats:
  - The biggest threat to defend against would be actual people with ill intentions. This would be comprised of 
  various levels of severity, with the more minor category being comprised of 
  unruly fans, hecklers, aggressively drunk people, etc., and more severe categories being comprised of people with more sinister intentions, such as shooters or bombers.
  A person that falls into any of these categories has potential to cause serious harm to themselves, the stadium, other spectators,
  the teams, and the reputation of the university- in short, all of the assets we care about. Thus it's our top priority to prevent these types of people from being allowed access.
  
  - Another threat, albeit more minor than the previous one, consists of unauthorized remote surveillance of the football team when they
  practice (or anybody else using the stadium, for that matter) via drone. This falls in line with the second point in the Assets category: protecting the teams by preventing an unfair advantage. If someone were able to observe the team's training regimen and what plays they
  were practicing, they could very well leak that information to rival teams, who could then devise their own counter-strategies. Such a
  threat has become a very real possibility these days (the Gatwick Airport shutdown due to drones comes to mind), and steps should be
  taken to protect against it.
- Countermeasures:
  - The most reasonable defense that should be immediately implemented would be physical barriers- walls, gates, partitions, and the
  like, both outside the stadium and around the field itself. On game days with high traffic, these barriers could be reinforced with on-duty security guards around the stadium and in the stands, who check the belongings of spectators entering the stadium. These defenses are the most simple way of preventing unauthorized entry into the stadium and onto the turf by both low and high-threat people alike, and ensuring the safety and peace of mind of those inside- a necessity well worth investing into. Furthermore, the costs for such defenses are relatively cheap- the physical barriers' financial costs mainly come from the initial order and installation, and do not require constant supervision or maintenance if properly implemented except on game days. As for the security team, costs can be kept low by only increasing the number of people on duty on game days.
  - For the more minor threat of remote surveillance, a simple countermeasure comes to mind: a security guard assigned the task of
  monitoring the surrounding area for drones or other unauthorized equipment. Should he spot any, he would alert the team, who could then refrain from practicing specific plays, as well as law enforcement if necessary. The benefit is that any would-be snoopers are immediately deterred, and anyone else still brave enough to try would be swiftly caught. This ensures the football team may continue to practice without fear of giving away their secrets to others. The costs are relatively minor, as well- it's simply the cost of paying one security guard for their job.
